# Simple-Method-For-Extracting-Symmetry-from-Meshes

This is a sample implementation for our paper titled A Simple Method for Extracting Symmetry from Meshes.

## Run Project

1. Install Processing Development Environment (PDE)
2. Click on run button
* In order to change the model, edit line 62 on Sym.pde file `String filename=<filename.off>;`
* w,a,s,d keys can be used to move the model. Click gray buttons for zoom in and zoom out.
* Change the parameters `translateSpeed`,`zoomRate` and `scale` on Sym.pde :

     for TOSCA :  `scale=5f` `zoomRate=0.5f` and `translateSpeed=1f`
     
     for SCAPE :  `scale=500f` `zoomRate=0.5f` and `translateSpeed=0.1f`
